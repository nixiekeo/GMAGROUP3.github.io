                <h2>The Early Development of General Mariano Alvarez (GMA), Cavite</h2>
                <p>The municipality of General Mariano Alvarez (GMA), located in the province of Cavite, has a rich and fascinating history that dates back to the 1960s. Originally part of the municipality of Carmona, GMA was once a resettlement area for families relocated from Quezon Memorial Park in Diliman, Quezon City.

                    The development of the area began in March 1968, with the help of various government agencies and private organizations. The People's Homesite and Housing Corporation (PHHC) prepared the basic development concepts, while the National Planning Commission (NPC) and the Department of Health (DOH) provided support. The 51st Engineering Brigade of the 514th Engineering Battalion of the Philippine Army built the access road and internal roads within the project.</p>

                <p>In 1977 and 1978, the Sangguniang Bayan of Carmona endorsed resolutions to convert the area into a new municipality.
